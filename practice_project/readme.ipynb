    "#You can use an optional first positional argument to a Field to designate a human-readable name. That’s used in a couple of #introspective parts of Django, and it doubles as documentation. If this field isn’t provided, Django will use the machine-#readable name. In this example, we’ve only defined a human-readable name for Question.pub_date. For all other fields in this #model, the field’s machine-readable name will suffice as its human-readable name.\n",

It’s useful for checking what Django is going to do or if you have database administrators who require SQL scripts for changes.\n",
